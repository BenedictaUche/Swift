                        <p>Rasha lives with her family in a difficult situation but aspires to own a beauty salon
                            business. Through our aid in
                            supplementing a $2125 loan, she has overcome her financial difficulties and made a
                            home-based business into a large,
                            independent beauty center that she owns in the city of Ibrid.

                            allowed her dream to be fulfilled by providing a loan that Haneen later used to buy clothes
                            for different ages and
                            styles.

                        <p>Mehrona is a seamstress in the Temurmalik region, and for the past four years, she has been
                            working in this
                            craftsmanship. With SWIFT funding her loan, Mehrona bought a new sewing machine and fabrics
                            to increase her income
                            significantly. This loan supported artisans upholding Tajik traditions, and their families.

                            keeping the culture of the Fijian people alive. Through SWIFT, we provided a loan to
                            Miliana. She used this loan to
                            cultivate her land to plant Kava and build a sustainable business of a kava shop.

                            children. This is why she has a
                            business selling children's and adult clothing. Her profits heavily decreased due to the
                            COVID-19 crisis. She invested

                            supporting this loan, it’s helping

                        <p>Samruai's cattle market is one of the largest in Northeast Thailand. She desired to increase

                            market demand. As a result, she sought a loan to purchase more cows and expand her farm. It
                            enabled her to purchase
                            enough materials for her farm and will assist her as a local woman entrepreneur.
